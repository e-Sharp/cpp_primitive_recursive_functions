# Primitive and General Recursive Functions in C++

This library is intended for educational purposes.

It provides facilities to play around with primitive and general recursive functions.
It is designed for the syntax to be as simple and natural as possible.

It also provides stronger type checking; if it compiles it should be somewhat valid.

# Usage

This is an header-only library. You only need to include the required headers into your own source files.

## Adaptating this for your own needs

You can, according to the MIT licence, do almost whatever you want with this library.
For example you might want to adapt it to your own conventions - naming, parameter order - or to provide additional facilities.

In order to do that, you can just fork this repository, modify it and redistribute it.

It might get a little difficult if you're not familiar with C++, so don't hesitate to ask.

# Compatibility

It requires a compiler supporting some early C++20 features.

Developped under MSVC 19.27.

# Examples

// TODO

# Future

I don't intend to put much more effort into maintaining this.
It more than outdid its purpose in my case.

I will still look at issues and PRs so don't hesitate to submit one.

## Possible improvements

- Compile-time evaluation
- Lazy evaluation for primitive recursion
- Better error reporting
- Compatibility for other compilers (C++14 compatibility should be easily achievable)

It isn't very optimized either since C++ metaprogramming is hard for me to get right.

# Origin

I made this library while following a class on calculability in my master's degree during the autumn semester of 2020.
We had some exercises on paper - programming on paper is quite boring tbh - so I decided to make a C++ library in order both to verify my solutions and make it more fun.

While using a functional programming would have been a much wiser choice, I happen to quite fancy C++; that's it.
I got to try some recent and advanced features of C++ which was really fun.

It was made over a span of less than a week.
